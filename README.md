## Installation Instructions 

\*\***_To view on Heroku, no installation is required!_**\*\*

To view locally, run NPM install to add in all necessary node packages. Next, add in your database information to the .env file.  You can then create the database by loading into mysql ('mysql -u root -p', password) and running 'source db/schema.'  After quitting, run 'node seeds/seed.js' to seed the database.  Finally, run 'node server.js' in the terminal and the application will run via localhost
